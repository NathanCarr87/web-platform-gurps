        "You have a 360° field of vision. You have no penalty to defend against attacks from the sides or rear. You can attack foes to your sides or rear with- out making a Wild Swing, but you are at -2 to hit due to the clumsy angle of attack (note that some Karate tech- niques do not suffer this penalty). Finally, you are at +5 to detect Shadowing attempts, and are never surprised by a danger that comes from behind, unless it also is concealed from sight.",

This gives +3 to Body Sense and Navigation (Air, Land, or Sea).
